Actually this is silly but in order to avoid alot of head aches
Firstly we have currently Four parts of the system 
Resource Edge Core and this consist of two projects
Authmanager and Resource Edge Logic
we also have resource layer which consists of
Resource Edge Domaina and webUI

leave long stories for now...
When you pull from git Check into testbranch2 for Former working edge ot TestBranch3 for current changes
when you check into testbranch3, this would give you assess to the most current development updates
Firstly, change the connection strings for the projects which is found in both Authmanager and WebUi webconfig
This project uses migrations to keep the database sychronized, you must run the update the database command 
from the package manager configuration console. if this fails with error message of "More than one Configuration Context found in the assembly resourceedge.webUi"
then you have to use the Configuration Command when running the Update command, and this configuration Context is found in the migration Folder of each project
You are advised to run the AuthManager migration first, because it creates the required AspNet Tables.
then the Domain Migration can then be ran.
Example you can run the Update command for the Authmanager using
-- Update-database -ConfigurationTypeName:AuthManager.Migration.Configuration -verbose
this shoulf run the update command successfully
